  <h1> A Rock Paper Scissors app, played against your device with computer vision. </h1>
 
 
### :hand: :fist: :v:

![Demo](demo/demo.gif)

</div>

## Game Instructions:

 * Once the hand overlay is displayed, make an OK sign to initialize the round (:ok_hand:).
 * The top text will display "SHOOT!" and begin processing input to determine your play, display one of :hand:, :fist:, or :v:. 
 * Your play and the device's will be displayed, along with the round's winner.
 * Tap anywhere on your screen to reset.

## Helpful Tips:

 * On the first instance of running this game, it may take up to ten seconds to process and display the hand overlay. 
 * The device begins collecting evidence of your play immediately after you stop holding the :ok_hand: gesture. It will take about one second of holding your gesture for an older iPhone to confidently accept your play, where the process is almost immediate on an iPad Pro.
